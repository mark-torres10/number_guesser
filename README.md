# Number Guesser

Simple implementation of number guessing game, written in simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with d3.js for the visualization). This was implemented in vanilla JS to demonstrate that simple web applications, such as this, could be created without the use of frameworks such as React or Angular. This platform is also an introduction, in an easy-to-understand, interactive format, to basic search algorithms (and in particular, binary search). 

Below is a demo of the website:
