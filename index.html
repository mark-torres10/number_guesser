            <p class="theory-text">When you played the game, how did you first approach it? 
                Were you like most people, who just guessed numbers at random? When most people play this game, 
                they just guess at random. If you guess at random, then sometimes you might get it right on the 
                first try, but other times it might take you 10 or 20 tries, if not more, to get it right. 
                If you're trying to get lucky, this approach works fine. But when you were doing this, how many guesses was it 
                taking you before you got to the right answer?</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="theory-text">What's the best way to play the game?</h3>
            <p class="theory-text">The best way to play the game is to use an approach known as binary search 
                (check out this <a class="theory-text" style="margin: 0;" href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html">link</a> for a great
                demonstration of how it works!)</p>
            <p class="theory-text">Let's first start with assuming that our missing value is 80</p>
            <p class="theory-text">You start at the middle of your possible range. In this case, since we're guessing numbers from 
            0 to 100, you should first start at 50. Assuming that the missing number isn't 50, you immediately cut out half of your
            possible numbers.
