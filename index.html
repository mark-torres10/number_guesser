            <h1 class="theory-text">Is there a best way to play the game?</h1>
            <h3 class="theory-text">What did you think of trying first?</h3>
            <p class="theory-text">When you played the game, how did you first approach it? 
                Were you like most people, who just guessed numbers at random? When most people play this game, 
                they just guess at random. If you guess at random, then sometimes you might get it right on the 
                first try, but other times it might take you 10 or 20 tries, if not more, to get it right. 
                If you're trying to get lucky, this approach works fine. But when you were doing this, how many guesses was it 
                taking you before you got to the right answer?</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="theory-text">What's the best way to play the game?</h3>
            <p class="theory-text">The best way to play the game is to use an approach known as binary search 
                (check out this <a class="theory-text" style="margin: 0;" href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html">link</a> for a great
                demonstration of how it works!)</p>
            <p class="theory-text">Let's first start with assuming that our missing value is 80</p>
            <p class="theory-text">You start at the middle of your possible range. In this case, since we're guessing numbers from 
            0 to 100, you should first start at 50. Assuming that the missing number isn't 50, you immediately cut out half of your
            possible numbers. 
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text"> For this example, our range is now limited to numbers between 51 and 100, since our first guess was too low. 
                Your next guess should be 75, since this is halfway between 51 and 100. 
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text">Now, 75 is too low, so now your missing number has to be between 76 and 100. You should guess 88 next,
                because this number is halfway between 76 and 100.
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text">Now, 88 is too high. So, you know that your missing number has to be between 76 and 88. You should
                guess 82 next, since this number is halfway between 76 and 88. 
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text">Now, 82 is too high. So, you know that your missing number is between 76 and 82. You should
                guess 79 next, since this number is halfway between 76 and 82. 
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text">Now, 79 is too low, so you know that the number has to be between 80 and 82. You should guess 81 
                next, since this number is halfway between 80 and 82. 
            </p>
            <p class="theory-text">Now, 81 is too high. Since you know that 79 was too low and 81 was too high, the missing number must be 80.</p>
            <p class="theory-text">At long last, you figured out that 80 was the missing number! You were able to figure that out in 7 tries!</p>

            <p class="theory-text">Although it might have felt that it took you a long time to get to the right answer, if you use this approach, you will always get 
                to the right answer in 7 or more tries! For an explanation of why this is the case (and as an introduction to time complexity analysis), 
                check out this link <a class="theory-text" style="margin:0;" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complexity-analysis-of-binary-search/">here</a>!

            <h3 class="theory-text">Try it out for yourself, and see how many tries it takes you before you get the right answer!</h3>
